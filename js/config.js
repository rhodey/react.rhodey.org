  title    : "The RadioWitness.io DSP Pipeline Part 2, Decoding P25",
  summary  : "In the second entry of this series I walk you step by step through the process of decoding digital bits from an analog RF signal. The fundamentals of *Digital Signal Processing* are all covered in detail including sampling, frequency translation, resampling, baseband filtering, demodulation, and decoding. This is the *\"DSP for Software Engineers\"* guide I wish I had 18 months ago."

  title    : "The RadioWitness.io DSP Pipeline Part 1, Where to Start?",
  summary  : "The [Radio Witness Project](http://radiowitness.io) began in 2015 with the goal of making police radio broadcasts more accessible to journalists. From the very start it was obvious that this would be a lot of work but I really didnâ€™t expect 18 months and three cycles of burnout. In this first post I introduce the project and explain how surprisingly difficult it was to find a starting point. Spoiler: GNURadio made me cry."

  title    : "Walking Past Same-origin Policy, NAT, and Firewall for Ethereum Wallet Control",
  summary  : "This vulnerability was originally reported to the Etherum Bug Bounty on June 12th, 2016. As far as I can tell no clients have been patched and any developer made aware of this has since forgotten. At the core of this attack is a *DNS Rebinding* vulnerability, in this post I explain the vulnerability, suggest an exploit, and leave you with a complete proof-of-concept exploit solution."
