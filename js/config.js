config.entries['dillinger-daemon'] = {"filename":"md/dillinger-daemon.md","path":"dillinger-daemon","date":"September 16, 2016","title":"A Daemon for the Dillinger Markdown Editor","summary":"I use Vim as my one, true text editor and generally do a great job of abstaining from other GUI-based editors and IDEs. However, time and time again I lose this battle when it comes to editting markdown. It's embarassing to admit, but I used to rely on [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/) to edit markdown before spending a few months with the [Vim Markdown Plugin](https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown). All that changed today when I discovered [Dillinger](https://github.com/joemccann/dillinger)."};

config.entries['radiowitness-decoding-p25'] = {"filename":"md/radiowitness-2.md","path":"radiowitness-decoding-p25","date":"September 14, 2016","title":"The RadioWitness.io DSP Pipeline Part 2, Decoding P25","summary":"In the second entry of this series I walk you step by step through the process of decoding digital bits from an analog RF signal. The fundamentals of *Digital Signal Processing* are all covered in detail including sampling, frequency translation, resampling, baseband filtering, demodulation, and decoding. This is the *\"DSP for Software Engineers\"* guide I wish I had 18 months ago."};

config.entries['uuid-use-with-caution'] = {"filename":"md/uuid-use-with-caution.md","path":"uuid-use-with-caution","date":"September 12, 2016","title":"UUID, Use With Caution","summary":"I began toying with HFT (High-Frequency Trading) on the [Coinbase GDAX Exchange](https://www.gdax.com/) in May of 2016. While reading through the GDAX API documentation for [placing a new order](https://docs.gdax.com/#place-a-new-order) I was excited to read the following: *\"The optional `client_oid` field must be a UUID generated by your trading application. This field value will be broadcast in the public feed for received messages.\"*"};

config.entries['radiowitness-where-to-start'] = {"filename":"md/radiowitness-1.md","path":"radiowitness-where-to-start","date":"August 8, 2016","title":"The RadioWitness.io DSP Pipeline Part 1, Where to Start?","summary":"The [Radio Witness Project](http://radiowitness.io) began in 2015 with the goal of making police radio broadcasts more accessible to journalists. From the very start it was obvious that this would be a lot of work but I really didnâ€™t expect 18 months and three cycles of burnout. In this first post I introduce the project and explain how surprisingly difficult it was to find a starting point. *Spoiler: GNURadio made me cry*."};

config.entries['ethereum-wallet-exploit'] = {"filename":"md/ethereum-exploit.md","path":"ethereum-wallet-exploit","date":"July 6, 2016","title":"Walking Past Same-origin Policy, NAT, and Firewall for Ethereum Wallet Control","summary":"This vulnerability was originally reported to the Etherum Bug Bounty on June 12th, 2016. As far as I can tell no clients have been patched and any developer made aware of this has since forgotten. At the core of this attack is a *DNS Rebinding* vulnerability, in this post I explain the vulnerability, suggest an exploit, and leave you with a complete proof-of-concept exploit solution."};

config.entries['some-midi'] = {"filename":"md/some-midi.md","path":"some-midi","date":"July 18, 2014","title":"Some MIDI","summary":"Early in the Summer of 2014 I was lucky enough to drive a junky old bus days up North and spend a full week with friends and community at [ToorCamp](http://toorcamp.toorcon.net/). I wish I had done more to document the ways in which we [broke](https://twitter.com/liliakai/status/489122375506489346) and fixed this bus and how the bus broke and fixed us in return but all I have to tell you now is that at some point in that trip my laptop screen cracked, badly. My broken laptop led to weeks of unproductivity but concluded in my first MIDI composition."};

config.entries['twitter-squat'] = {"filename":"md/twitter-squat.md","path":"twitter-squat","date":"June 5, 2014","title":"Fighting Twitter Squatters","summary":"At the time of writing this some bot is squatting [@rhodey](http://twitter.com/rhodey) on Twitter and has been for some time. I don't remember to check the availability of this handle very frequently and would hate to have it open up only to be squatted again so I put together this simple bash script."};

config.entries['ssh-fish-feeder'] = {"filename":"md/ssh-fish-feeder.md","path":"ssh-fish-feeder","date":"December 17, 2012","title":"SSH Fish Feeder","summary":"It was the day before Winter Break 2012 and I had no more than 30 minutes to finish packing before getting the boot from my dorm room. I had everything packed in the back of my Subaru and made my way upstairs for a final look-around, wait-- what was that? The sound of running water? Could it be that the fish tank my friends and I went in on together somehow ended up in my room? **It could. it was. lame.**"};

config.entries['stratfor-relationship-graph'] = {"filename":"md/stratfor.md","path":"stratfor-relationship-graph","date":"June 28, 2012","title":"Stratfor Relationship Graph","summary":"WikiLeaks began publishing [The Global Intelligence Files](http://wikileaks.org/the-gifiles.html) in 2012, over five million e-mails from the Texas headquartered \"global intelligence\" company Stratfor. Sometime during that summer **long, long before [d3.js](https://d3js.org/)** I spent a few hours paging through these emails. Wikileak's website allows you to browse by date of release or date of the document itself but this method of examination soon lost my interest, what I really wanted was a holistic understanding of the emails without having to think all that much."};

config.entries['4chan-regex'] = {"filename":"md/4chan-regex.md","path":"4chan-regex","date":"January 1, 2007","title":"4chan Regex Practice","summary":"**Many, many years ago** I decided that I needed some regex practice, and background aside I'd like to think that any survey is a survey worth sharing. What follows is a quick survey of the sex and age of 4chan commenters using exclusively shell commands. This is the bottom of the barrell my friends."};
